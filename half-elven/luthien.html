    <h5>Princess of Doriath</h5>
    <p>Of all the Half-Elven, Luthien was the most powerful in so many ways. She was the only Child of Illuvatar to born child of a Maiar.</p>
    <p>Her parents were Elu Thingol, King of the Sindar and Doriath, Lord of all Beleriand, and Melian the Maia of Illuvatar.</p>
    <p>Lúthien's story is one of the most beautiful and important in all the history of Arda.</p>
